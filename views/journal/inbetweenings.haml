    %h2 Inbetweenings: a tumblr blog
    %p 
      I enjoy taking note of the small things I see when I'm out walking or staring idle. 
      %a{:href => "http://inbetweenings.tumblr.com/"} The resultant pics were a good reason to begin a tumblr blog, 
      which I'm updating whenever I see something interesting, as I post directly from my iPhone. What are pictures of? They're of things inbetween, if you will.
