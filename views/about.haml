		%p I design communications for both page and screen. I plan, create and build assets that enhance value for business and culture. In industry terms, I'm a senior designer and art director with over twelve years experience.

		%p I live in Melbourne, Australia with my wife and young daughter, where I also collect vinyl records of all kinds, read about software eating the world, and try to practise unwired boredom. Read more about my past work and what drives my sensibility:

		%h3 How I work

		%p I work within the contradictory fields of emotion and logic, and aim to communicate a lot of information with ease and distinction. As such, I concentrate on the essence of Why, not the hang-up of What. The result is often defined by what’s not there as much as what is.

		%p The work begins by defining purpose: I eliminate the extraneous and focus on essence and usefulness. Collaboration is a necessity throughout the work process, as requirements develop and opportunities unfold.

		%p Craft is everything. Clear thinking and smart ideas may connect people; attentiveness in executing the ideas enables a seamless experience.

		%p My goal is to create work that’s elegantly effective, for today and tomorrow.

		%h3 About this site

		%p
			I designed and hand-coded this site using a Ruby on Rails app that my friend
			%a{:href => "http://tuzinsky.com/"} Bobes Tuzinsky
			created for me. I use Haml and Sass to write each page, I manage this code though Github and when I push new changes, a script updates Heroku, where I host my site. You can read more about the process
			%a{:href => "/journal"} in my journal.
