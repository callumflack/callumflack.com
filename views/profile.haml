      I design communications for both page and screen. I plan, create and build assets that enhance value for business and culture.

    %h2 How I work
    
    :markdown
      I work within the contradictory fields of emotion and logic, and aim to communicate a lot of information with ease and distinction. As such, I concentrate on the essence of Why, not the hang-up of What. The result is often defined by what’s not there as much as what is.

      The work begins by defining purpose: I eliminate the extraneous and focus on essence & usefulness. Collaboration is a necessity throughout the work process, as requirements develop and opportunities unfold.
      
      Craft is everything. While clear thinking and smart ideas will connect people, only care and attentiveness will enable a seamless experience.

      I aim to build work that’s elegantly effective, now and tomorrow.
      
    %h2 About this site
    
    %p 
      I designed and hand-coded this site using a Rails app that my friend 
      %a{:href => "http://www.quora.com/Callum-Flack"} Bobes Tuzinkzy 
      created for me. I use Haml and Sass to write each page, I manage this code though Github and when I push new changes, a script housed on my Github also updates Heroku, where I host my site. You can read more about the process
      %a{:href => "/journal"} in my journal. 
    
    %p All work on this site is &copy; Callum Flack 2012, except for the photograph of myself and my daughter which my wife shot.
