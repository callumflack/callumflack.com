    %p I design for page and screen. I plan, create and build communication assets for business and culture. 

    :markdown
      I work within the contradictory fields of emotion and logic, and aim to communicate a lot of information with ease and distinction. As such, I concentrate on the essence of Why, not the hang-up of What. The result is often defined by what’s not there as much as what is.

      The work begins by defining purpose: I eliminate the extraneous and focus on essence & usefulness. Collaboration is a necessity throughout the work process, as requirements develop and opportunities unfold.

      Craft is everything. While clear thinking and smart ideas will connect people, only care and attentiveness will enable a seamless experience.

      I aim to build work that’s elegantly effective, now and tomorrow.

      I live in Melbourne, Australia with my wife and newborn daughter, where I also collect vinyl records of all kinds, read about software eating the world, and try to practise unwired boredom.
