            I enjoy taking note of the small things I see when I'm out walking or staring idle.
            %a{:href => "http://inbetweenings.tumblr.com/"} The resultant pics were a good reason to begin a tumblr blog,
            which I'm updating whenever I see something interesting, posted unedited, uncropped, directly from my iPhone. What are the pictures of? They're of things inbetween, if you will.
