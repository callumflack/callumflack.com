            I design and build communications for screen, page and spaces
            by focussing on Why, not What.

            Clarity is often mistaken for simplicity. Rather, effortless relevance requires
            partnership, questioning, feedback, seeing multiple viewpoints, and the challenge
            of focus and elimination. Opportunities always arise in this process, and agile
            collaboration helps to make best use of them.

            This is why I work best when I'm engaged to define the purpose at the beginning:
            design is not just how it looks but how it works.

            And I'm a designer who codes. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript so I can
            not only implement "pixel-perfect" interfaces but also design them to maximise the
            user experience and build them using the right method for the situation.

            I am a thoughtful, reflective designer trying to make useful, sustainable products.
            My goal is to create work that’s elegantly effective, for today and tomorrow.

            An infrequent newsletter about noticing the details and seeing them within larger patterns.
            In an attempt to build a cult following, I'm putting up a social promise…

            I live in Melbourne, Australia with my wife and young daughter, where I also collect
            [vinyl records of all kinds] (https://sites.google.com/site/coloronetear/ "A decade of soul 45 mixtapes"),
            read about software eating the world, and try to practise unwired boredom.

            I designed and coded this site using a Sinatra Rails application deployed using Heroku.
