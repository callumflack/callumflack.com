      Previous to my efforts for Roundtable Records, I redesigned the look and feel of 
      %a{:href => "http://www.votarydisk.com/"} Votary Records. 
      Votary's output so far has been centred around the recordings of Sven Libaek, Australian composer, record producer and musician. His soundtrack for Ron & Val Taylor's 
      %a{:href => "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcctzAsXBN8"} Inner Space
      (I also designed the MadMan DVD package as well) is a brilliant example of the fertile music languishing in an anti-thetic Australia, and gained a second lease of life when a few tracks were used in Wes Anderson's ‘The life aquatic with Steve Zizzou’.

      I've also been working with local Melbourne garage-soul band 
      %a{:href => "http://www.facebook.com/TheThePerfections"} The Perfections, 
      to develop an identity which has begun with their first EP release. And I'm working with DJ Sheep and his Bullet Proof Crates label visual identity for a range of interesting new projects.
