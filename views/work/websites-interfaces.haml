  %article.info
    %p I worked with Box+Dice Software over two and a half years from 2009, initially working exclusively on the visual identity development in conjunction with the CEO and later, in a full-time position, I integrated into a team of developers as front-end designer. I learned how to code from expert developers who'd done their 10,000 hours and whlie I don't see it as my priority, I've garnered a solid foundation of HTML and CSS. These days, I really enjoy using haml and scss through a local Ruby app set-up by my good friend Bobes. The work I'm most happy with I now know to be riddled with small coded mistakes (how else does one learn?), but I'm still satisfied with the application of the visual identity to the interface, the large scrolling pages telling the products stories simply, and the attention to small details such as the footer hover states at the base of each product page.

    %p While at Box+Dice I worked closely with the specialist iOS developers Dangerous Pixels to produce the interface for the Box+Dice iPad app. A terrific set of people, I also worked for them and continue to discuss user experience and user interface tidbits with them.
