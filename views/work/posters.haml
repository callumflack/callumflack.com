    %p While in London, I worked at an ethnic minority consultancy as an inhouse designer. I produced a series of posters for Vision Opera while working there, the Dido & Aenaes being my favourite.
    %p I also worked at Saatchi & Saatchi's Design house in London, where I produced the Sagatiba work after being let loose on a month's work of Brazil photographs and the line "spirit of Brazil".

    %p Millennius was an event for Australian Fashion Week in Brisbane, 1998. The Arabian Nights poster was for the reputed Griffin Theatre Company, Sydney.
    %p The Individual was an excuse to use some custom lettering ideas in a psuedo-futurist way, cut to an Adam Curtis quote.
