        %p
          I bumped into James Pianta after moving to Melbourne in 2007. James shares my enthusiasm for all things pressed on a record. He had already begun reissuing records but was short designer to manage his next set of projects and after a short period, we'd revised the look and feel of his primary label,
          %a{:href => "http://www.votarydisk.com/"} Votary Records.
        %p James began a new label called Roundtable Records in 2009 and I was asked to provide the look and feel of the label. At present the discography is at 10 LPs, with another 3 in production and a list of projects in waiting.

        %p.first Some releases are reissued recordings while others are first issues of recordings that were lost and found. We always used the original cover art (we don't want to take away from the music and it's history) but incorporated it into an LP template system so that each release is obviously Roundtable.
        %p Our releases are now widely available in reputed records shops throughout Europe and the USA. Only 10% of the pressings are made available in Australia.
