    %p My first professional gig out of art school was with George Patterson Bates in Brisbane, 2001. In a frenetic year at the agency, I developed a good relationship with the creative director, and the the Breaka redesign, after being given free reign by the CD, was entirely mine. I drew completely new lettering and applied it to the packaging vertically rather than horizontally, so that it was bigger. Its recently chalked up it's 10 year anniversary, but with an adjusted visual identity of unfortunate additional faux-3D styling, minus the wave patterns.

      The second project shown is the redesigned men's Imperial Leather packaging for aftershave and anti-perspirant. I produced this while freelancing at 
      %a{:href => "http://mullandesign.com.au/?portfolio=imperial-leather-mens-range"} Mullan Design, Melbourne. 
      We upgraded the iconography, colour systems, packaging materials and introduced new typography guidelines.
