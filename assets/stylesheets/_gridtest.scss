    $INTRODUCTION
\*------------------------------------*/
/**
 * csswizardry grids provides you with widths to suit a number of breakpoints
 * designed around devices of a size you specify. Out of the box, csswizardry
 * grids caters to the following types of device:
 *
 * palm     --  palm-based devices, like phones and small tablets
 * lap      --  lap-based devices, like iPads or laptops
 * portable --  all of the above
 * desk     --  stationary devices, like desktop computers
 * regular  --  any/all types of device
 *
 * These namespaces are then used in the library to give you the ability to
 * manipulate your layouts based around them, for example:
 *
   <div class="grid__item  one-whole  lap--one-half  desk--one-third">
 *
 * This would give you a grid item which is 100% width unless it is on a lap
 * device, at which point it become 50% wide, or it is on a desktop device, at
 * which point it becomes 33.333% width.
 *
 * csswizardry grids also has push and pull classes which allow you to nudge
 * grid items left and right by a defined amount. These follow the same naming
 * convention as above, but are prepended by either `push--` or `pull--`, for
 * example:
 *
   `class="grid__item  one-half  push--one-half"`
 *
 * This would give you a grid item which is 50% width and pushed over to the
 * right by 50%.
 *
 * All classes in csswizardry grids follow this patten, so you should fairly
 * quickly be able to piece together any combinations you can imagine, for
 * example:
 *
   `class="grid__item  one-whole  lap--one-half  desk--one-third  push--desk--one-third"`
 *
   `class="grid__item  one-quarter  palm--one-half  push--palm--one-half"`
 *
   `class="grid__item  palm--one-third  desk--five-twelfths"`
